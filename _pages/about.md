  Hello, here is ZaychikLiu, welcome to my personal website! 

  ## 🎉Basic Infromation

  My name is Feiyang Liu（刘飞扬）, I am a sophomore undergraduate majoring in Intelligent Science and Technologyat the School of Automation at South China University of Technology.

  ## 🔥News

  * I am now searching for remote intern and summer intern, please contact me if you are interested!
  * I am going to UCSD/UT-Austin as a visiting student from 2024.9 to 2025.1. Welcome future classmates! I look forward to interacting with you all!

  ## 📑Publications and Projects

  ### Publication

  Not Publications yet, but I believe that if you are willing to cooperate with me, we can definitely produce good papers！

  ### Projects

  * 2022.11 - 2023.1 **Automatic classification and pricing of canteen dishes based on machine vision.**

  ## 📖Education

  * 2022.9 - now, Undergraduate student, South China University of Technology. (Project 985, a top 25 university in Chinese mainland)
  * Ongoing 2024.9-2025.1, UCSD.

  ### Current GPA: 

  3.75/4, rank 16/96 (It is a sad story👇)

  ### Core courses:

  * Advanced Mathematics(4.0/4.0)
  * Linear Algebra(4.0/4.0)
  * Probability Theory and its Applications(4.0/4.0)
  * C++ Advanced Programming(4.0/4.0)
  * Data Structure(4.0/4.0)
  * And so on......

  > It is worth mentioning that, last semester, I was diagnosed with moderate depression due to confusion about my own value, that's why my ranking fell from 7/289 or 5/96 to 16/96(this professional diversion is more promising). However, this semester marks a turning point for me, as I refocused on pursuing subjects that genuinely interest me. This experience has not only honed my resilience but also serves as a reminder of my innate learning capabilities, as evidenced by my earlier academic successes.🎉
