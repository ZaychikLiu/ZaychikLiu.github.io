Hello, here is ZaychikLiu, welcome to my personal website! 

## üéâBasic Infromation

My name is Feiyang LiuÔºàÂàòÈ£ûÊâ¨Ôºâ, I am a sophomore undergraduate majoring in Intelligent Science and Technologyat the School of Automation at South China University of Technology.

## üî•News

* I am now searching for remote intern and summer intern, please contact me if you are interested!
* I am going to UCSD/UT-Austin as a visiting student from 2024.9 to 2025.1. Welcome future classmates! I look forward to interacting with you all!

## üìñEducation

* 2022.9 - now, Undergraduate student, South China University of Technology. (Project 985, a top 25 university in Chinese mainland)
* Ongoing 2024.9-2025.1, UCSD/UT-Austin.

### Current GPA: 

3.75/4, rank 16/96 (It is a sad storyüëá)

### Core courses:

* Advanced Mathematics(4.0/4.0)
* Linear Algebra(4.0/4.0)
* Probability Theory and its Applications(4.0/4.0)
* C++ Advanced Programming(4.0/4.0)
* Data Structure(4.0/4.0)
* And so on......

> It is worth mentioning that, last semester, I was diagnosed with moderate depression due to confusion about my own value, that's why my ranking fell from 7/289 or 5/96 to 16/96(this professional diversion is more promising). However, this semester marks a turning point for me, as I refocused on pursuing subjects that genuinely interest me. This experience has not only honed my resilience but also serves as a reminder of my innate learning capabilities, as evidenced by my earlier academic successes.üéâ
